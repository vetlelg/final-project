        <p>
          About seven million people die worldwide every year from air pollution, and
          91% of the world population breathe air that contains high levels of pollutants.
          WHO has called air pollution "a silent public health emergency".
          There are over one million confirmed deaths worldwide from covid-19, many suffer
          lasting health effects and the economic and social impacts are devastating.
          Disruptions caused by Covid-19 could reverse decades of progress in healthcare worldwide.
          We hope that Expozance can contribute to solving some of these problems and
          give better health and well-being for its users, which is essential to
          sustainable development and is one of United Nations sustainable development goals.
