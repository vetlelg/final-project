        <h3>Air pollution detection</h3>
      </header>

      <p>
        The Expozance detects the presence and concentration
        of five of major pollutants; ground-level ozone, particle pollution,
        carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.
        These measurements are used to determine outdoor air quality.
        In addition, the Expozance also detects and measures the
        concentration of radon, asbestos, cigarette smoke and
        other substances to determine indoor air quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        With these real-time measurements your bracelet will
        tell you when the air surrounding you is safe and when
        you should leave your current environment. This will be
        shown by different color-codes and air-quality-measurements.
        The air quality measurements will be done according to the
        Air Quality Index, which is the standard measurement of
        air pollution used across most of the world <a href="sources.html">[5]</a>.

        <h3>Virus update</h3>
      </header>

      <p>
        As real-time virus detection is not yet possible, we still want to
        keep you updated during these times of the coronavirus. We understand
        the continuing stream of constantly changing information can be tedious,
        which makes the importance of getting updated information easily
        imperative. The device will use your location and get information about
        the risk of exposure from statistics provided by the Norwegian Institute
        of Public Health (NIPH) <a href="sources.html">[6]</a>. These statistics
        will be updated daily and shows number of reported cases in the county
        and municipality where you are located at the moment. Therefore, if you
        travel from county to county, municipality to municipality, you will
        be informed instantly and easily.
      </p>

      <p>
        The device use the traffic light system <a href="sources.html">[7]</a>,
        a system of three colors - red, yellow and green - representing risk
        levels:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Red zone - high risk</li>
        <li>Yellow zone - moderate risk</li>
        <li>Green zone - low risk</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Remember that the information obtained doesnâ€™t contain the unreported
        cases. Hence, we encourage practice of caution even if there is no or
        low known risk. In the future we hope to develop real-time virus
        detection.

          One of the choices is how you want
          to see the information. You can choose to display both
          air-pollution and virus information at the same time
          with a split screen function. Or you can have either
          as your default screen and use the button on the side
          to change screen.

        <p>
          In addition to color codes there will be text describing
          what zone you are in both for air-pollution and coronavirus.
          This is to make it easier sholud you suffer from color blindness.

          To accommodate your preferences you can choose to have a sound
          or vibration played to alert you of zone-changes. Both from a
          lower danger level to a higher one and from a higher to a lower
          danger level. In addition there is a choice to substitute sound
          with a voice telling you what changed. This might especially be
          beneficial should you have trouble with your eyesight.

          You can easily access the settings screen by holding the
          button on the side for about 3 seconds. Here you will
